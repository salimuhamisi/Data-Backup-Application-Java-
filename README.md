This is Android application that enables you to upload and retrive data in your mobile phone or any device to cloud storage.
Files that can be uploaded to cloud storage are Images, Videos, Documents and Audios. 
The cloud storage used is Firebase.
The application allows you to upload files that you think are confidential or risky to remain in the local storage, or if your local storage is small
and yet need to hold more data.
The application can retrive your data too, from firebase, and you can download them.
